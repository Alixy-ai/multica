# External CLI agents

An agent with `runtime_kind` set to `acp` drives an external command-line agent instead of calling an LLM provider. It runs in the agent's workspace and streams its output into the chat.

## Supported runtimes

- **Codex CLI** — `codex exec --sandbox danger-full-access <prompt>`
- **Claude Code** — `claude -p --output-format stream-json --permission-mode bypassPermissions --max-turns <n> <prompt>`
- **Pi Agent** — the Pi ACP adapter (`pi`)
- **OpenCode** — the OpenCode ACP server (`opencode`)
- **DeepSeek Harness** — `dsh`, a Cordis plugin tree whose ACP surface is prompt-only (no `session/set_model` or tool-call updates over the wire). Its per-mode sandbox confinement (bwrap/Landlock/Seatbelt/Windows restricted tokens) fails closed with `SANDBOX_UNAVAILABLE` when unusable.
- **Custom** — any program speaking the Agent Client Protocol over stdio.

## Installing

Qunica detects and launches these CLIs; it does not manage their accounts. Install each one and sign in outside the app. The runtime version panel can install a preset globally through npm and reports the installed and latest versions.

## Configuration

- **command** and **args** — what to run.
- **model** — which model the CLI should use, when it accepts one.
- **thinking_effort** — reasoning depth, for runtimes that expose it. Codex and Claude Code spell this differently; Qunica maps it per profile.
- **timeout_seconds** — how long one run may take.
- **permission_policy** — how to answer the CLI's permission prompts.

## Shared group notes

In groups with a local workspace, Qunica automatically supplies the `qunica-group-notes` stdio MCP server on ACP `session/new` and `session/load`. It provides `ReadGroupNotes`, `CreateGroupNote` and `EditGroupNote`; the CLI may prefix the tool names. No user MCP configuration or additional interpreter is needed. Notes stay in the group's bound workspace even if the agent runs in an independent workspace or task worktree. See [Shared notes](groups.md#shared-notes) for arguments and lifecycle guarantees.

The executable's internal `--qunica-group-notes-mcp` mode runs only the stdio relay, before UI or backend startup. A session-owned loopback broker holds host authority; the relay receives an opaque capability via its MCP environment, not an account credential or database path. Operations are permitted only during the current dispatch. This preserves reusable ACP sessions without giving idle CLI processes continuing access to notes. Runtime adapters that ignore `mcpServers` do not gain these tools merely from the host prompt.

## Auditing

Every external run records its command, working directory, status, exit code, and the tail of stdout/stderr, so a failure can be diagnosed without rerunning it.

## Safety

These CLIs are configured for full-auto execution: they can read and write anything the account can, and the preset flags disable their own confirmation prompts. Bind them only to a workspace whose contents you are willing to have modified.
